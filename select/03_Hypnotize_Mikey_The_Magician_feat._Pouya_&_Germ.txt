Hypnotize

Ay

Hypnotize
Hit the flo'
Hypnotize

Gun by the left
Fuck boy on sight
Don't talk to no label
My money on top of the table
For me and my people
We really not equal
I find these bitches
Divide 'em inside of my ride
3 in the back, 2 on my lap
Sophisticated on my fuckin' sack
Still got them thoughts in the back of the lac
Who you talking to with that
Tone of your voice
I gotta get money
I don't got a choice
Gotta support myself and my boys
Family first
Talking sideways you get murked
Fill up your body with dirt
Playin' with fire boy you gon' get burnt
Got that Glock tucked right under my shirt
Lil bitch

Hypnotize
Hit the flo'
Hypnotize

I got a death grip
Get hit real quick
I can't relate to a bitch
Fuck a problem no negotiation
Call of duty boy its domination
Pocket rockets like i got the aces
Boy I'm Liam Neeson
Now they know I'm taking what I want
Put that boy down with the pump
Don't give a fuck
You ain't a tough guy
You a Clay Aiken
Pushing buttons in your play station
Leave you devastated
Leave you mortified
Pistol dancin' Kevin Federline
I'm reckless you don't want drama
Rollin' with a zoo I got a llama
Ben Stiller couldn't dodge us
Knock that boy out like I'm Ronda

Hypnotize
Hit the flo'
