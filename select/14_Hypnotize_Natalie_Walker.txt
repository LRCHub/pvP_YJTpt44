Hypnotize me
Stupefied
Yea you've got me stupefied
Hypnotized
Oh you've got me hypnotized

The way he moved will never leave my mind
He hypnotized me
And now I'm on this high

Stupefied
Yea you've got me stupefied
Hypnotized
Oh you've got me hypnotized

When our eyes met
I knew I could never look away
I could feel his heat and I began to shake
I never knew a man could have such an effect
He shook me up
Now I'll never be the same

Do you feel the power of what you're doing to me
I am helpless to your touch
Your electricity
I never knew a man could have such an effect
You shook me up
Now I'll never be the same

You shook me up
You shook me
You shook me up
You shook me
