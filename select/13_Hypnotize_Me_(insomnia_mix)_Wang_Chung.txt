Darlin', I believe in love
Since I met you, baby I believe in love
The way you hold me, my heart is stirred
You can control me without a word

Turn on your white light in my open eyes
Oh girl, you hypnotize me
I feel your white light, you're so bright
I'm hypnotized

And as you're looking at me
It's a deep ecstasy and no word is enough
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love

Oh darlin', I believe in love
In this hate-ridden world I believe in love
Do you know the power you have over me?
Use it every hour, shine the light on me

Turn on your white light in my open eyes
Oh girl, you hypnotize me
I feel your white light, you're so bright
I'm hypnotized

And as you're looking at me
It's a deep ecstasy and no word is enough
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love

Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn your light around
Turn me on

Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love, oh
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love, yes

Turn on your white light in my open eyes
Oh girl, you hypnotize me
I feel your white light, you're so bright
I'm hypnotized

And as you're looking at me
It's a deep ecstasy and no word is enough
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love
Just shine the light in your eyes
And hypnotize me love

Just shine the light in your eyes
And hypnotize me love, yeah yeah, oh
Yeah, just shine the light in your eyes
And hypnotize me love
Just shine the light
